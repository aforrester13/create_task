			<p id="purpose">
				The purpose of this website is to help students complete tedious mathematical equations in an instant,
				allowing them to use this knowledge for their own benefit. The differentfeatures on this website
				include a GPA/QPA Calculator, a Time converter (to convert units of time), and a Measurement
			  converter (to convert units of measure).</p>

					<p id="gpaCalcText">
						GPA, or grade-point average, is one of the most important aspects of student life. It defines
						your overall academic ability to learn, comprehend, and reproduce the information when tested
						upon it. However, many do not know how it is actually calculated. The formula for your grade-
						point average is <strong>(GRADES * CREDITS) / CREDITS</strong>. It takes the grade you earned
						for a class, multiplies it with the number of credits or credit hours received for that specific
						class, and does this for each class you partake in. Then it adds these values together and
						divides it by the total amount of credits or credit hours to get your GPA value. What we have
						done is made it much simpler than doing all of this math yourself and created a calculator that
						does it for you! Simply input your letter grades, the number of credit hours spent on each class,
						and press CALCULATE, and there's your GPA!</p>

					<h3 id="gpaCalc">QPA Calculator</h3>
					<p id="qpaCalcText">
						QPA, or quality-point average, is very similar to the way GPA is calculator, but is specific to
						number grades instead of letter grades. It's very uncommon in most schools, however, still provides
						some importance if a students wants to know their exact number grade. It is calculated by the formula
						<strong>(GRADES * CREDITS) / CREDITS</strong> as well, however, the grades are numbers, not letters, and
						hours are actually equal to the credits received from taking a class or course. Multiply the individual grade
						by the credit cost of the class, add them all up and divide by the total number of hours to get your result.
						Our calculator does all of this tedious math for you, letting you acquire your number grade in an instant</p>

					<h3 id="gpaCalc">Measurement Converter</h3>
					<p id="measureCalcText">
						As we all know, the world uses two different types of measurement system; the Metric and the U.S. Standard system.
						The Metric system uses simple multiples of ten to describe length, weight, and volume, while the U.S. standard system
						does not have a specific rule set for its measurements. For this converter, we will be focusing on the length and measurement
						branch of the Metric V.S. Standard System. In this converter, you will be able to change between centimeters to inches,
						to miles, kilometers to meters, and so on.

						You want to know how many hours in the next coming weeks? You want to know how many seconds there are in one year?
						You want to know how many weeks there are in 48 months? We got you covered. Our simple, easy-to-use Time Converter
						will have you changing between units of time in milliseconds. Simply choose which units of time you want to convert between
						and insert a value into the first box, and there you go!</p>
